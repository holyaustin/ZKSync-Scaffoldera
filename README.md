# üíª Developer Experience

### üêï What is husky

Husky improves your git commits.

You can use it to lint your commit messages, run tests, lint code, etc... when you commit or push. Husky supports all Git hooks.

#### ü™ù Hooks

- pre-commit: lint app codebase
- commit-msg: apply commintlint

### üìã What is commitlint

commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the [conventional commit format](https://conventionalcommits.org).

In general the pattern mostly looks like this:

```sh
type(scope?): subject  #scope is optional; multiple scopes are supported (current delimiter options: "/", "\" and ",")
```

Real world examples can look like this:

```
chore: run tests on travis ci
```

```
fix(server): send cors headers
```

```
feat(blog): add comment section
```

Common types according to [commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum) can be:

- build
- chore
- ci
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test
